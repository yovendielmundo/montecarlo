A Method to Estimate π (3.14...)

Consider a square and a circle of radius one inside a square:
   
   Ratio between the surfaces of 1/4 of a circle and 1/4 of a square: 
   ```
   λ = ( ((1ˆ2)π/4) / (2ˆ2/4) ) = π/4
   ```

Estimating λ: randomly sample points inside the square, count how many fall inside the circle, multiply this ratio by 4 for an estimate of π
